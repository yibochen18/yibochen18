# Hi, I'm Yibo 👋

I’m a current **M.S. student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at UCLA** under the advising of Dr. Lin Yang interested in building **efficient, reliable, and scalable systems** at the intersection of software, hardware, and machine learning.

I enjoy working across the stack, from **C++ at the systems layer** to **full-stack apps in TypeScript**, and **digital systems in SystemVerilog**. I'm particularly interested in **computer architecture, embedded systems, and VLSI systems**.
